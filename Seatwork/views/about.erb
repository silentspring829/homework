	This hotel did not exist a few hours ago. You'll be in for quite an experience.
	<br> 
	<br>
	You are guaranteed to make an entrance at the Hotel Cipriani, even if you don't arrive in your own yacht. One of the most charming things about this hotel is its island location, which means the only way to arrive - or leave - is by boat. A non-stop shuttle boat to St Mark's Square, just five minutes away, lets you enjoy the best views in town on the trip over. However, you may find yourself venturing into town less often than you had planned, choosing instead to unwind in the Cipriani's glorious gardens, which even contain a swimming pool - the only one in Venice.
